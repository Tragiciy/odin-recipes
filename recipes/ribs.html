    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats the taste of a nice, juicy rib that’s been perfectly rendered in the Slow Cooker for several hours. I’ve watched my good friend Pete make these ribs on several occasions, and recently, he let me in on his secrets to success. <span>(<i>Score!</i>)</span> -And now, you can reap the benefit.</p>
    <p>The dry rub adds a ton of flavor to the meat. The acidity from the Dijon mustard breaks down the fibers in the meat as it cooks, which makes it perfectly tender. Cooking it low and slow makes it fall off the bone, and finishing it in the oven or the grill caramelized the juicy BBQ topping.</p>
    <p>Let’s go over what you need, how to make it, how (and why) you remove the membrane, and <span><i>more</i></span>:</p>

    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list dots">
        <li>2 racks <b>baby back ribs</b>, 4-5 pounds</li>
        <li>1/3 cup <b>Dijon mustard</b>. The acidity helps to break down and tenderize the meat</li>
        <li>18 oz. <b>barbeque sauce</b></li>
        <li>½ cup <b>chicken broth</b></li>
        <li>1 <b>yellow onion</b>, sliced into quarters and separated</b></li>

    <ol class="list numbers">
        <li>Remove the membrane (see section below for detailed instructions) and pat it dry. Cut each rack in half if they’re too long to fit in the Slow Cooker.
        </li>
        <li>Massage the rub seasoning into the top and bottom.</li>
        <li>Brush the top and bottom with Dijon mustard and the top with BBQ sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth to the Slow Cooker, stack the ribs on top and sprinkle the onions and garlic over it.</li>
        <li>Cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8.</li>
        <li>To remove them from the Crock Pot: Slide a long sturdy spatula underneath one side and gently grip the other side with kitchen tongs. Carefully transfer them to a foil-lined baking sheet. (Bone side up for the oven, bone side down for the grill.) Brush generously with BBQ Sauce.</li>
        <li>Oven: Preheat to a low broil at 450°. Grill: Preheat to medium at 350°.</li>
        <li>Cook the ribs for 5 minutes. Flip and brush with BBQ Sauce. Cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip one more time, brush with sauce, bake for 5 minutes.<i> <b>Serve!</b></i></li>
